hi everyone !

the code that you must run is 'sort_times.py' 

The idea of this project is to understand the runtime complexities for the three types of sorting:

1) Merge sort
2) Insertion sort
3) Quick sort

The output will show you each size and it's time taken using each sort. This will give us a better understanding of how each sort runtime complexity works.
