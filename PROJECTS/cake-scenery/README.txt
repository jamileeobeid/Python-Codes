hello everyone!!

I am excited to share my first simple project that I did for my university python course.

This project is about a scenery with a birthday cake.

When you run the code, you will choose the width of the cake from the given range, then the cake will be drawn for you. After that you will choose the length of the table also from the given range and it's desired color. Then you will see the full scenery. You can tap anywhere on the screen to exit.
